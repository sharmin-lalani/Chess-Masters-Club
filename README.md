# Chess-Masters-Club

# Project Overview

    The sole function of the system is managing an Online Chess Club 
    where game lovers can learn and play Chess games for fun and take part in tournaments.

    A general user can view tutorials and learn how to play chess. 
    A registered user can play games against their friends or random opponents. 
    They can use the save-and-restore feature to play multiple games simultaneously. 
    They will be rated for their game play.

    A tournament player can take part in online tournaments. 
    The admin/tournament manager conducts tournaments and manages the database. 
    The admin announces the start date for a tournament,
    the last date for registration and the maximum number of players that can take part. 
    A tournament can either be open for all registered players 
    or user rankings maybe used as a cut-off.
